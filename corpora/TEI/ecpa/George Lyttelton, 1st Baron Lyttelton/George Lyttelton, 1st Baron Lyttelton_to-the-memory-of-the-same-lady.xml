    <lg n="1">
     <l n="1">AT length escap'd from ev'ry human eye,</l>
     <l n="2">From ev'ry duty, ev'ry care,</l>
     <l n="3">That in my mournful thoughts might claim a share,</l>
     <l n="4">Or force my tears their flowing stream to dry,</l>
     <l n="5">Beneath the gloom of this embow'ring shade,</l>
     <l n="6">This lone retreat, for tender sorrow made,</l>
     <l n="7">I now may give my burden'd heart relief,</l>
     <l n="8">And pour forth all my stores of grief,</l>
     <l n="9">Of grief surpassing ev'ry other woe,</l>
     <l n="10">Far as the purest bliss, the happiest love</l>
     <l n="11">Can on th' ennobled mind bestow,</l>
     <l n="12">Exceeds the vulgar joys that move</l>
     <l n="13">Our gross desires, inelegant, and low.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="2" stanza_type="ten-line">
     <l n="14">Ye tufted groves, ye gently-falling rills,</l>
     <l n="15">Ye high o'ershadowing hills,</l>
     <l n="16">Ye lawns gay-smiling with eternal green,</l>
     <l n="17">Oft have you my LUCY seen!</l>
     <l n="18">But never shall you now behold her more:</l>
     <l n="19">Nor will she now with fond delight</l>
     <l n="20">And taste refin'd your rural charms explore.</l>
     <l n="21">Clos'd are those beauteous eyes in endless night,</l>
     <l n="22">Those beauteous eyes where beaming us'd to shine</l>
     <l n="23">Reason's pure light, and Virtue's spark divine.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="3">
     <l n="24">Oft would the Dryads of these woods rejoice</l>
     <l n="25">To hear her heav'nly voice,</l>
     <l n="26">For her despising, when she deign'd to sing,</l>
     <l n="27">The sweetest songsters of the spring:</l>
     <l n="28">The woodlark and the linnet pleas'd no more;</l>
     <l n="29">The nightingale was mute,</l>
     <l n="30">And ev'ry shepherd's flute</l>
     <l n="31">Was cast in silent scorn away,</l>
     <l n="32">While all attended to her sweeter lay.</l>
     <l n="33">Ye larks and linnets now resume your song,</l>
     <l n="34">And thou, melodious Philomel,</l>
     <l n="35">Again thy plaintive story tell.</l>
     <l n="36">For death has stopt that tuneful tongue,</l>
     <l n="37">Whose musick could alone your warbling notes excel.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="4">
     <l n="38">In vain I look around</l>
     <l n="39">O'er all the well-known ground</l>
     <l n="40">My LUCY'S wonted footsteps to descry;</l>
     <l n="41">Where oft we us'd to walk,</l>
     <l n="42">Where oft in tender talk</l>
     <l n="43">We saw the summer sun go down the sky;</l>
     <l n="44">Nor by yon fountain's side,</l>
     <l n="45">Nor where its waters glide</l>
     <l n="46">Along the valley, can she now be found:</l>
     <l n="47">In all the wide-stretch'd prospect's ample bound</l>
     <l n="48">No more my mournful eye</l>
     <l n="49">Can aught of her espy,</l>
     <l n="50">But the sad sacred earth where her dear relicks lie.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="5">
     <l n="51">O shades of H—y, where is now your boast?</l>
     <l n="52">Your bright inhabitant is lost.</l>
     <l n="53">You she preferr'd to all the gay resorts</l>
     <l n="54">Where female vanity might wish to shine,</l>
     <l n="55">The pomp of cities, and the pride of courts.</l>
     <l n="56">Her modest beauties shun'd the publick eye:</l>
     <l n="57">To your sequester'd dales</l>
     <l n="58">And flow'r-embroider'd vales</l>
     <l n="59">From an admiring world she chose to fly;</l>
     <l n="60">With Nature there retir'd, and Nature's GOD,</l>
     <l n="61">The silent paths of wisdom trod,</l>
     <l n="62">And banish'd every passion from her breast,</l>
     <l n="63">But those, the gentlest and the best,</l>
     <l n="64">Whose holy flames with energy divine</l>
     <l n="65">The virtuous heat enliven and improve,</l>
     <l n="66">The conjugal, and the maternal love.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="6">
     <l n="67">Sweet babes, who, like the little playful fawns,</l>
     <l n="68">Were wont to trip along these verdant lawns</l>
     <l n="69">By your delighted Mother's side,</l>
     <l n="70">Who now your infant steps shall guide?</l>
     <l n="71">Ah! where is now the hand whose tender care</l>
     <l n="72">To ev'ry Virtue would have form'd your Youth,</l>
     <l n="73">And strew'd with flow'rs the thorny ways of Truth?</l>
     <l n="74">O loss beyond repair!</l>
     <l n="75">O wretched Father left alone</l>
     <l n="76">To weep their dire misfortune, and thy own!</l>
     <l n="77">How shall thy weaken'd mind, oppress'd with woe,</l>
     <l n="78">And drooping o'er thy LUCY'S grave,</l>
     <l n="79">Perform the duties that you doubly owe,</l>
     <l n="80">Now she, alas! is gone,</l>
     <l n="81">From folly, and from vice, their helpless age to save?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="7">
     <l n="82">Where were ye, Muses, when relentless Fate</l>
     <l n="83">From these fond arms your fair disciple tore,</l>
     <l n="84">From these fond arms that vainly strove</l>
     <l n="85">With hapless ineffectual Love</l>
     <l n="86">To guard her bosom from the mortal blow?</l>
     <l n="87">Could not your fav'ring power, Aonian maids,</l>
     <l n="88">Could not, alas! your pow'r prolong her date,</l>
     <l n="89">For whom so oft in these inspiring shades,</l>
     <l n="90">Or under Campden's moss-clad mountains hoar,</l>
     <l n="91">You open'd all your sacred store,</l>
     <l n="92">Whate'er your ancient sages taught,</l>
     <l n="93">Your ancient bards sublimely thought,</l>
     <l n="94">And bade her raptur'd breast with all your spirit glow?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="8" stanza_type="twelve-line">
     <l n="95">Nor then did Pindus' or Castalia's plain,</l>
     <l n="96">Or Aganippe's fount your steps detain,</l>
     <l n="97">Nor in the Thespian vallies did you play;</l>
     <l n="98">Nor then on Mincio's bank</l>
     <l n="99">Beset with osiers dank,</l>
     <l n="100">Nor where Clitumnus rolls his gentle stream,</l>
     <l n="101">Nor where through hanging woods</l>
     <l n="102">Steep Anio pours his floods,</l>
     <l n="103">Nor yet where Meles, or Ilissus stray,</l>
     <l n="104">Ill does it now beseem,</l>
     <l n="105">That, of your guardian care bereft,</l>
     <l n="106">To dire disease and death your darling should be left.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="9">
     <l n="107">Now what avails it that in early bloom,</l>
     <l n="108">When light fantastic toys</l>
     <l n="109">Are all her sex's joys,</l>
     <l n="110">With you she search'd the wit of Greece and Rome?</l>
     <l n="111">And all that in her latter days</l>
     <l n="112">To emulate her ancient praise</l>
     <l n="113">Italia's happy genius could produce;</l>
     <l n="114">Or what the Gallic fire</l>
     <l n="115">Bright-sparkling could inspire,</l>
     <l n="116">By all the Graces temper'd and refin'd;</l>
     <l n="117">Or what in Britain's isle,</l>
     <l n="118">Most favour'd with your smile,</l>
     <l n="119">The pow'rs of reason and of fancy join'd</l>
     <l n="120">To full perfection have conspir'd to raise?</l>
     <l n="121">Ah what is now the use</l>
     <l n="122">Of all these treasures that enrich'd her mind,</l>
     <l n="123">To black oblivion's gloom for ever now consign'd?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="10" stanza_type="twelve-line">
     <l n="124">At least, ye Nine, her spotless name</l>
     <l n="125">'Tis yours from death to save,</l>
     <l n="126">And in the temple of immortal Fame</l>
     <l n="127">With golden characters her worth engrave.</l>
     <l n="128">Come then, ye virgin sisters, come,</l>
     <l n="129">And strew with choicest flow'rs her hallow'd tomb.</l>
     <l n="130">But foremost thou, in sable vestment clad,</l>
     <l n="131">With accents sweet and sad,</l>
     <l n="132">Thou, plaintive Muse, whom o'er his Laura's urn</l>
     <l n="133">Unhappy Petrarch call'd to mourn,</l>
     <l n="134">O come, and to this fairer Laura pay</l>
     <l n="135">A more impassion'd tear, a more pathetick lay.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="11">
     <l n="136">Tell how each beauty of her mind and face</l>
     <l n="137">Was brighten'd by some sweet, peculiar grace!</l>
     <l n="138">How eloquent in ev'ry look</l>
     <l n="139">Thro' her expressive eyes her soul distinctly spoke!</l>
     <l n="140">Tell how her manners by the world refin'd</l>
     <l n="141">Left all the taint of modish vice behind,</l>
     <l n="142">And made each charm of polish'd courts agree</l>
     <l n="143">With candid Truth's simplicity,</l>
     <l n="144">And uncorrupted Innocence!</l>
     <l n="145">Tell how to more than manly sense</l>
     <l n="146">She join'd the soft'ning influence</l>
     <l n="147">Of more than female tenderness:</l>
     <l n="148">How in the thoughtless days of wealth and joy,</l>
     <l n="149">Which oft the care of others' good destroy,</l>
     <l n="150">Her kindly-melting heart,</l>
     <l n="151">To ev'ry want, and ev'ry woe,</l>
     <l n="152">To guilt itself when in distress</l>
     <l n="153">The balm of pity would impart,</l>
     <l n="154">And all relief that bounty could bestow!</l>
     <l n="155">Ev'n for the kid or lamb that pour'd its life</l>
     <l n="156">Beneath the bloody knife,</l>
     <l n="157">Her gentle tears would fall,</l>
     <l n="158">Tears from sweet Virtue's source, benevolent to all.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="12">
     <l n="159">Not only good and kind,</l>
     <l n="160">But strong and elevated was her mind:</l>
     <l n="161">A spirit that with noble pride</l>
     <l n="162">Could look superior down</l>
     <l n="163">On Fortune's smile, or frown;</l>
     <l n="164">That could without regret or pain</l>
     <l n="165">To virtue's lowest duty sacrifice</l>
     <l n="166">Or int'rest's or ambition's highest prize;</l>
     <l n="167">That injur'd or offended never try'd</l>
     <l n="168">Its dignity by vengeance to maintain,</l>
     <l n="169">But by magnanimous disdain,</l>
     <l n="170">A wit that temperately bright,</l>
     <l n="171">With inoffensive light</l>
     <l n="172">All pleasing shone, nor ever past</l>
     <l n="173">The decent bounds that Wisdom's sober hand,</l>
     <l n="174">And sweet Benevolence's mild command,</l>
     <l n="175">And bashful Modesty before it cast.</l>
     <l n="176">A prudence undeceiving, undeceiv'd,</l>
     <l n="177">That nor too little, nor too much believ'd,</l>
     <l n="178">That scorn'd unjust Suspicion's coward fear,</l>
     <l n="179">And without weakness knew to be sincere.</l>
     <l n="180">Such LUCY was, when in her fairest days</l>
     <l n="181">Amidst th' acclaim of universal praise,</l>
     <l n="182">In life's and glory's freshest bloom</l>
     <l n="183">Death came remorseless on, and sunk her to the tomb.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="13">
     <l n="184">So where the silent streams of Liris glide,</l>
     <l n="185">In the soft bosom of Campania's vale,</l>
     <l n="186">When now the wintry tempests all are fled,</l>
     <l n="187">And genial Summer breathes her gentle gale,</l>
     <l n="188">The verdant orange lifts its beauteous head:</l>
     <l n="189">From ev'ry branch the balmy flow'rets rise,</l>
     <l n="190">On ev'ry bough the golden fruits are seen;</l>
     <l n="191">With odours sweet it fills the smiling skies,</l>
     <l n="192">The wood-nymphs tend it, and th' Idalian queen:</l>
     <l n="193">But in the midst of all its blooming pride</l>
     <l n="194">A sudden blast from Apenninus blows,</l>
     <l n="195">Cold with perpetual snows:</l>
     <l n="196">The tender blighted plant shrinks up its leaves, and dies.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="14">
     <l n="197">Arise, O Petrarch, from th' Elysian bowers,</l>
     <l n="198">With never-fading myrtles twin'd,</l>
     <l n="199">And fragrant with ambrosial flowers,</l>
     <l n="200">Where to thy Laura thou again art join'd;</l>
     <l n="201">Arise, and hither bring the silver lyre,</l>
     <l n="202">Tun'd by thy skilful hand,</l>
     <l n="203">To the soft notes of elegant desire,</l>
     <l n="204">With which o'er many a land</l>
     <l n="205">Was spread the same of thy disastrous love;</l>
     <l n="206">To me resign the vocal shell,</l>
     <l n="207">And teach my sorrows to relate</l>
     <l n="208">Their melancholy tale so well,</l>
     <l n="209">As may ev'n things inanimate,</l>
     <l n="210">Rough mountain oaks, and desart rocks, to pity move.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="15">
     <l n="211">What were, alas! thy woes compar'd to mine?</l>
     <l n="212">To thee thy mistress in the blissful band</l>
     <l n="213">Of Hymen never gave her hand;</l>
     <l n="214">The joys of wedded love were never thine,</l>
     <l n="215">In thy domestic care</l>
     <l n="216">She never bore a share,</l>
     <l n="217">Nor with endearing art</l>
     <l n="218">Would heal thy wounded heart</l>
     <l n="219">Of ev'ry secret grief that fester'd there:</l>
     <l n="220">Nor did her fond affection on the bed</l>
     <l n="221">Of sickness watch thee, and thy languid head</l>
     <l n="222">Whole nights on her unwearied arm sustain,</l>
     <l n="223">And charm away the sense of pain:</l>
     <l n="224">Nor did she crown your mutual flame</l>
     <l n="225">With pledges dear, and with a father's tender name.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="16" stanza_type="twelve-line">
     <l n="226">O best of wives! O dearer far to me</l>
     <l n="227">That when thy virgin charms</l>
     <l n="228">Were yielded to my arms,</l>
     <l n="229">How can my soul endure the loss of thee?</l>
     <l n="230">How in the world to me a desart grown,</l>
     <l n="231">Abandon'd, and alone,</l>
     <l n="232">Without my sweet companion can I live?</l>
     <l n="233">Without thy lovely smile,</l>
     <l n="234">The dear reward of ev'ry virtuous toil,</l>
     <l n="235">What pleasures now can pall'd Ambition give?</l>
     <l n="236">Ev'n the delightful sense of well-earn'd praise,</l>
     <l n="237">Unshar'd by thee, no more my lifeless thoughts could raise,</l>

     <l n="246">That none has any comfort to bestow.</l>
     <l n="247">My books, the best relief</l>
     <l n="248">In ev'ry other grief,</l>

     <l n="250">Each fav'rite author we together read</l>
     <l n="251">My tortur'd mem'ry wounds, and speaks of LUCY dead.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="18">
     <l n="252">We were the happiest pair of human kind!</l>
     <l n="253">The rolling year its varying course perform'd,</l>
     <l n="254">And back return'd again,</l>
     <l n="255">Another and another smiling came,</l>
     <l n="256">And saw our happiness unchang'd remain;</l>
     <l n="257">Still in her golden chain</l>
     <l n="258">Harmonious Concord did our wishes bind:</l>
     <l n="259">Our studies, pleasures, taste, the same.</l>
     <l n="260">O fatal, fatal stroke,</l>
     <l n="261">That all this pleasing fabrick Love had rais'd</l>
     <l n="262">Of rare felicity,</l>

     <l n="270">With impious grief complain.</l>
     <l n="271">That all thy full-blown joys at once should fade</l>
     <l n="272">Was his most righteous will, and be that will obey'd.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg n="19">
     <l n="273">Would thy fond love his grace to her controul,</l>

     <l n="275">Her pure exalted soul</l>
     <l n="276">Unjustly for thy partial good detain?</l>
     <l n="277">No — rather strive thy grov'ling mind to raise</l>
     <l n="278">Up to that unclouded blaze,</l>

     <l n="289">Whose peaceful path and ever open gate</l>
